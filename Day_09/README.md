# File Upload Service

This repository contains code for a file upload service built using Express.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, and Nodemailer. Below are the topics covered and what we learn from the provided code snippets:

## Topics Covered

1. **Setting up Express Server**
   - Configuration of an Express server instance.
   - Environment variable management using `dotenv`.
   - Connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.

2. **File Upload Middleware**
   - Integration of `express-fileupload` middleware for handling file uploads.
   - Configuration for temporary file storage.

3. **Routing with Express Router**
   - Creation of route handlers using Express Router.
   - Routing endpoints for various file upload operations.

4. **Database Connectivity**
   - Establishment of database connection using Mongoose.
   - Handling connection errors and retries.

5. **Email Notifications**
   - Implementation of email notifications using Nodemailer.
   - Sending notifications upon successful file upload.

6. **Schema Definition with Mongoose**
   - Definition of a file schema with Mongoose.
   - Fields include `name`, `imageUrl`, `tags`, and `email`.

7. **Cloudinary Integration**
   - Configuration and connection setup with Cloudinary for file storage.
   - Upload of files to Cloudinary with options for quality and folder.

8. **File Upload Controllers**
   - Controller functions for handling local file uploads, image uploads, video uploads, and image size reduction.
   - Validation of file types and sizes.

9. **Asynchronous Operations**
   - Usage of `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations such as database queries and file uploads.

10. **Error Handling**
    - Implementation of error handling mechanisms for graceful error responses.
    - Proper logging of errors to aid debugging.

## What We Learn

1. **Express.js Fundamentals**: Setting up an Express server, routing, middleware usage.
2. **MongoDB Integration**: Connection setup, schema definition, and CRUD operations with Mongoose.
3. **File Upload Handling**: Middleware setup, validation, and uploading files to Cloudinary.
4. **Nodemailer Usage**: Sending email notifications upon events.
5. **Error Handling Strategies**: Proper error handling techniques for maintaining application robustness.
6. **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling asynchronous operations in Node.js using `async/await`.

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand these concepts in depth and customize the service as per your requirements.
